## Dataset

>Bay Wheels is a regional public bicycle sharing system in California's San Francisco Bay Area. It is operated by Motivate in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.[3] Bay Wheels is 'the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States. It was established as Bay Area Bike Share in August 2013. As of January 2018, the Bay Wheels system had over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose.[1]

>In June 2017 the system was officially re-launched as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company.[4] After Motivate's acquisition by Lyft, the system was renamed to Bay Wheels in June 2019.[5] The system is expected to expand to 7,000 bicycles around 540 stations in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, and San Jose.[6]  For further info https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Wheels. 


>This data set includes information about individual rides made in a Ford GoBike bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. Data set contains variables & data about 180000 bike riding record. These records include data for February 2019. There are 21 different types of variables for each ride related with ride duration, time, gender, age, date,stations & users. 


## Summary of Findings

* Thursday & Tuesday are the most popular days. Monday,wednesday and friday counts are very close. But weekend days are obvioulsy lower than working days.

* There are peak hours in the system at the start (08-09) and the end (17-18) hours.

* 99% of the trips have times under 55 minutes.In addition, the vast majority of them seem to have times between 5 and 10 minutes. It corresponds to an average usage of 11 minutes.

* The vast majority of users are male. Male with a very high rate of 74%.
The average age is 34. The vast majority of users fall in the 25-35 age bracket. We can say that the age range in which the working population is predominant. 

* Vast majority of trips are made by subscribers.

* When we look at the travel time distribution as customer vs subscriber, a clear view emerges. The distribution of subscribers is spread over a narrower band. In other words, subscribers make shorter and more focused journeys than customers. In contrast, customers are more diverse in distribution, meaning they usually rent bikes for longer periods of time.

* Customers provide a more stable and constant usage from day to day. Subscribers, on the other hand, show heavy use on weekdays, while the intensity of use at weekends drops drastically.

* Those who use weekdays are slightly older 

* Although the number of weekend uses is decreasing, the average usage time per trip is increasing.

* The average usage time is increasing for all users over the weekend, but the rate of increase in customers is higher than others.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> Only **Customer/female** user group shows the same demand on weekends as on weekdays. In other groups, demand decreases over the weekend.

> Despite the decrease in the total number of trips over the weekend, there is a significant increase in avg duration for the customer group on the weekend. The demand of the customer group is increasing over the weekend. This can be considered as an opportunity and can be used to balance the total decline with the right marketing.

> It can be said that there is a density of around 8 and 17 on weekdays for two of the customers and subscribers. However, this is experienced at a higher intensity in subscribers. Customers have a relatively homogeneous distribution. On the weekend, it seems clear that customers prefer the afternoon time zone. But it shows a more homogeneous distribution compared to weekdays.
